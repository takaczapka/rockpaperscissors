ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
* specs2 expectation methods to be private
* maybe move html code out of servlet
* create a docker io distribution
* deploy to AWS
* use Mongo or other store for live results

NOTES:
* am I building a web application or an API? /html vs REST


* Why I don't like Specs2
    * in a suggested Specification style tests there is split between what's written in Spec and what's tested.
    It's easy to forget to update the spec when updated expected assertions.
    * I do miss OneInstancePerTest from ScalaTest - "isolated" doesn't seem to be working
    * After/Before/Scope style annoying
    * working with mocks as above
    * better keep expectation methods private to keep track which are actually in use (as spec can change meantime)
